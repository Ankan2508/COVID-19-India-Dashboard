This COVID-19 Dashboard is my second task as a #powerBI developer intern at InternCareer. The goal of this project is to create a comprehensive and informative dashboard that visualizes trends and vaccination details in India.



INSIGHTS FROM THE DASHBOARD:



The dashboard includes visualizations related to the following:



a. KPIs of confirmed, deaths, recovered, and active cases. Similarly, total doses administered demographically are also included. Total samples tested and positive and negative tests among them are included as well.



b. The dashboard also includes trend analysis of various factors like positive and negative cases, total deaths, recovery and mortality rate, and vaccination among different states over a period.



c. Total confirmed cases on a map.



d. Top 10 and bottom 10 visuals to understand various factors effectively.



The dashboard also includes slicers and filters, which allow users to explore the data in different ways. For example, users can filter the data by state, and time period to understand the trends better.
